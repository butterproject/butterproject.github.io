                    <p>Making Popcorn Time has been a big adventure, but there have been confusions by developers and users alike about what could and couldn't be done with the app.</p>
                    <p>Since we moved from github.com, we've realized that made it much harder for new devs to contribute. We also understand that the particularities of the App could make some people cautious in sharing their skills with us, and boy do we love sharing!</p>
                    <p>It's been almost a year since we have been having internal talks about how to mitigate this situation, and a lot of ideas were thrown around. Finally we decided to start Butter, a clear legal-friendly framework offering what Popcorn Time did legally, with the best technology possible.</p>

                    <h3 id="butteraidorgheadline1a">Butter?<a id="orgheadline1"></a></h2>
            				<p>This new project, hosted on <a href="https://github.com/butterproject/butter">GitHub</a>, is essentially your beloved Popcorn Time stripped down of the parts that made people wary. Butter was created so that anyone can contribute to great desktop and mobile apps that allows you to stream movies and shows from Bittorrent (and other sources, but more on that later) in a stylish and easy way.</p>
            				<p>We hope to clear doubts in developers so that we can continue doing what we love: hacking a great experience for our users.</p>
            				<p>Butter will be able to leverage all of the traditional Open Source internet infrastructure: it will have its own webpage at <a href="http://butterproject.org">butterproject.org</a>, its own twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/butterproject">@butterproject</a>, its own facebook at
            				    <a href="https://fb.me/ButterProjectOrg">fb.me/ButterProjectOrg</a> and its own G+ here <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/111003619134556931561">plus.google.com/communities/111003619134556931561</a>. We are making sure Butter is absolutely not using the popcorntime.io infrastructure, to make a clear separation of concerns.</p>
            				<p>We're making Butter like any Open Source project: open governance by the contributors and easy to fork. Planning on making a Popcorn Time clone? Don't do it from scratch, use some Butter to make it awesome!</p>
            				<p>Butter isn't only an empty shell, we want to make Butter a great app if you want to stream independent shows and tv shows. Right now all the content in Butter is provided by the amazing people at vodo.net, but if you know of any other sources with this kind of content please send us an email or better yet some code!</p>
            				<p>We will have binaries for you to test out soon!</p>
            				<hr class="primary"><h3 id="whataboutthemobileappsaidorgheadline3a">What about the mobile Apps?<a id="orgheadline3"></a></h2>
            				<p>The Apps teams are working at this very moment to get you the experience you love in Butter format. As it's a fair amount of work to clean them up, we could use some help! Have skills? Want to give a hand? Don't hesitate in contacting us!</p>
            				<hr class="primary"><h3 id="sowhatsnextaidorgheadline4a">So what's next?<a id="orgheadline4"></a></h2>
            				<p>Over the next few days we're going to finish porting all branches from the <a href="https://git.popcorntime.org">Popcorn Time git</a> to the Butter repos on Github, you can give us a hand or sit back and relax as history is happening.</p>

              				<h3>Is this legal?</h2>
              				<p>Depends on where you're from, really. Once again: we're using torrents, so if you really care, you'd better google what the legal situation around this protocol is where you live.</p>

              				<p>Chances are that most (if not all) of the movies available in Butter will be in English. However, languages for subtitles and the app itself are constantly being added by our lovely contributors.</p>
